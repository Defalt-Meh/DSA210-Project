# Spotify Data Analysis: Insights into My Listening Habits

## Introduction
This project delves into my personal Spotify listening habits by analyzing data from playlists and songs I listened to. Through this project, I aim to gain insights into my favorite artists, songs, and listening patterns over time. This analysis combines data visualization and exploration to uncover meaningful trends in my music preferences.

## Motivation
I wanted to explore my Spotify data to better understand my music taste, identify listening patterns, and find trends across playlists and time. Analyzing personal data like this provides a fun and informative way to combine music and data science.

## Data Source
- The data for this project comes from Spotify's personal data export feature and my manually curated playlists.
- Includes:
  - Song listening history (timestamps, song names, artists...).
  - Playlists with song details.
- **Note**: The raw data is not included in this repository for privacy reasons.

## Key Features
- Analysis of top artists and songs by listening hours and play counts.
- Time-based patterns in music consumption (hourly, daily, monthly).
- Unique vs. non-unique songs in playlists.
- Visual representation of insights using:
  - Bar charts for top artists and songs.
  - Pie charts for unique vs. non-unique songs.
  - Word clouds for favorite songs and artists.
  ```

## **Techniques Used**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To clean and understand the data.
- Visualization: Using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create graphs.
- Time Series Analysis: To explore trends over hours, days, and months.

  **Below are examples of the insights gained through visualizations:**
  - Top Artists and Songs: By listening hours and play counts.
  - Unique vs. Non-Unique Songs: Pie chart representation.
  - Day-wise and Hourly Streaming Patterns: Time-based analysis.
  - Word Clouds: Highlighting favorite songs and artists.
